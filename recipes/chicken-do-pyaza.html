        <h1>Chicken Do Pyaza Recipe</h1>

        <p>Dopiaza meaning "two onions" is the name of two separate dishes, one in the Greater Iran region and one in South Asia. It refers to a family of recipes, typically meat-based, that contain onions as a major ingredient. There are two alternative etymological explanations for its name.
            Onions are added at two stages of cooking: chopped or ground in the marinade/gravy, and as a garnish/topping, either pickled or crisply fried.
            The recipe uses onions and meat in a 2:1 ratio.
            The dish usually contains a meat, usually beef, chicken, lamb, mutton, or shrimp; however, it can also be prepared in a vegetarian style, e.g., with okra.</p>
