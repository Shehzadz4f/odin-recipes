        <p>A falooda is a Mughlai cuisine version of a cold dessert made with vermicelli. It has origins in the Persian dish faloodeh, variants of which are found across West, Central, and South Asia. Traditionally it is made by mixing rose syrup, vermicelli, and sweet basil seeds with milk, often served with ice cream.</p>
        <h3>INGREDIENTS:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Milk</li>
            <li>Ice Cream</li>
            <li>Sabja seeds</li>
            <li>Vermicelli or sev</li>
            <li>Rose syrup</li>
            <li>Jelly</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>STEPS:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>First take ½ tablespoon sabja seeds (sweet basil seeds) in a bowl. You can check for some husks or stones if any and remove them.</li>
            <li>Then add water and stir.</li>
            <li>Soak the sabja seeds in the water for about 20 to 30 mins.</li>
            <li>After 30 minutes, you will see the sabja seeds fully soaked and will look gelatinous.</li>
            <li>Using a fine strainer drain the extra water from the sabja seeds. Cover and keep the soaked sabja seeds aside.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, begin to prepare the faluda sev according to package instructions. Some require just soaking the falooda sev in warm water.</li>
            <li>Then added 5 tablespoons sev (roughly ⅓ cup). If the faluda sev are long, then just break or chop them before cooking.</li>
            <li>Boil in the water on medium heat until the vermicelli have softened.</li>
            <li>Make sure the vermicelli have softened and cooked well.</li>
            <li>Once cooked, then strain them and drain the water. Rinse them in running water and set aside.</li>
            <li>Chop the nuts that you will be adding. I have added some cashews, almonds and pistachios. Raisins can be kept whole.</li>
            <li>In about 4 tall serving glasses each, add the rose syrup first. You can add about 1.5 to 2 tablespoons rose syrup depending on the sweetness preferred as well as the size of the glass.</li>
            <li>Then add 2 tablespoons of the soaked sabja seeds.</li>
            <li>Add 2 to 3 tablespoons of the falooda sev. After adding the sev, you can add some cubes or chunks of jelly/jello if you are using it.</li>
            <li>Add about 1 cup cold or chilled milk in a slow stream taking care that the milk does not mix with the rose syrup and the sabja seeds.</li>
            <li>Finally add a scoop of vanilla ice cream or pista ice cream or mango ice cream or malai kulfi.</li>
            <li>Top with sliced pistachios, golden raisins and sliced almonds. For a bright pop of color, you can decorate with a few glazed cherries or tutti-frutti.</li>
            <li>Serve falooda ice cream immediately. While drinking falooda, with a spoon mix the rose syrup settled at the bottom with the milk and then drink and eat the vermicelli, sabja seeds and nuts.</li>
        </ol>
